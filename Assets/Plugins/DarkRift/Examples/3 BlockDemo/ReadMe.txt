The BlockDemo is a more complex Minecraft clone and uses a plugin in DarkRift to authoritatively control the game.

To run, open the BlockDemoDarkRiftPlugin project in Visual Studio and update the references to your DarkRift files. Build 
the project and copy the generated DLL file into the Plugins folder of your DarkRift server.

Run the server.

If you haven't already done so, set RunInBackground to true in your Unity project settings.

You can now build the BlockDemo scene and run a few copies locally. You should see be able to move and use the mouse buttons 
to create/destroy blocks in the world!
