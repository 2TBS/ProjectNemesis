Hello testers!

Thanks for being part of the DarkRift alpha, without you DarkRift would remain very buggy for a long time!

There's a few things to know before your start:
1. The documentation is mostly done but you should be aware that:
	- The tutorial references downloading DarkRift from the asset store, you don't need to do this in case it's not obvious!
	- The tutorial doesn't yet go on to talk about rooms or the profanity filter.
	- The upgrading from DarkRift 1 section is not done yet!

2. There are a few major bugs still known to be in DarkRift, please check out the known issues and discord chat for the latest 
information on them and only send details if you think you can provide more/better information on them or if you don't think 
your bug has been found yet! Also, expect there to be a lot of bugs!

3. You currently have what will be the pro version so you can complete the whole tutorial, note though that when DarkRift is put 
into open beta you'll only have the pro version if you pay for it or have paid for DarkRift 1 Extreme! (Hence things might not 
work in your projects afterwards)

4. Things are very likely to change between test releases so don't be surprised if you suddenly get syntax errors or if previous 
releases no longer work together with new releases!

Go play around!
