Random UDP Disconnection:
	UDP sometimes randomly disconnects after around 10 seconds.
	Changing to TCP fixes this so it is an issue with Hazel.

Temperamental UDP Connection:
	Sometimes UDP will not connect to the server and report that it cannot be reached or worse, crash Unity.
	Changing to TCP should fix the issue, alternatively just keep trying!

Documentation is in a state:
	Since I moved the documentation to the HTML help it's a bit of a mess, this should be cleared up and
	rearranged in the next version.

No complete project for Agar tutorial:
	This will be in the next version once the documentation has been sorted out.
